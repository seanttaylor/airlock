# Airlock

### The Problem
Data privacy is fundamentally flawed. Once data is shared, on the receiving end there are no inherent controls preventing unauthorized copying, forwarding, or storage. Traditional encryption methods secure data in transit and at rest, but they fail to enforce policies on how decrypted data is used, leading to compliance risks and uncontrolled data exposure.

### Meet Airlock
Airlock introduces a structured data exchange format (`application/vnd.airlock+json`) built around *self-encrypting blobs* (SEBs) that enforce cryptographic policies before decryption. Instead of relying on external governance, Airlock embeds policy verification into the decryption process itself. This ensures that only authorized recipients, under predefined conditions, can access the plaintext data.

### Airlock Policy Engine and Key Server
Each Airlocked object contains a policy checksum, which a receiving system must validate against a policy engine before requesting the decryption key. The key server or DHT network holds the encryption keys but only releases them if the associated policy conditions—such as access limits, expiration times, or other constraints—are met. This creates a built-in enforcement mechanism for data access without relying on trust in the recipient.

### Integration and Use Cases
Airlock is designed for seamless integration into M2M communications, APIs, and client-side applications. It can be used in financial transactions, healthcare data exchanges, secure messaging, or even client-side applications that automatically Airlock outbound data to prevent leaks. This ensures that data privacy isn't just a legal checkbox but a cryptographically enforced reality.

### Conclusion
By combining self-encrypting data with a policy-enforced key release mechanism, Airlock redefines data security beyond simple encryption. It introduces a new paradigm where access control is intrinsic to the data itself, preventing unauthorized usage even after decryption.
